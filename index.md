## Ten, hut!

Alright, recruits! Welcome to the O-Course. Glad to have you.

My name is Sergeant Husky, and for the next hour or so, I’ll be leading you through the course. You will be doing two things here: learning, and hacking! Sound good?

You will be presented with a series of web application obstacles, and you’ll have the opportunity to learn about how they work, how they can be exploited, and then you can hack them to your heart’s content!

You want to be the greatest bug bounty hunter on Earth, do ya? Well, I would say that’s an admirable goal! But you gotta start with the basics, and you’ll learn the basics here. 

When you leave this course, I’m hoping you’ll be able to do these things (in the biz, we call these “Learning Objectives):
- Identify, understand, and exploit Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
-	Identify a SQL Injection point, perform manual SQL injection, and use SQLMap to gain unauthorized access to a backend database.
-	Identify and exploit an XML External Entity vulnerability to gain access to a web server’s file system.
-	Use a brute forcing tool to identify an API and use it to gain access to information.
-	Use Burp suite, dirbuster, SQLMap, XXS Strike, Nmap, and other tools and begin to gain mastery with them.
-	And, of course… have fun and look cool while doing it!
